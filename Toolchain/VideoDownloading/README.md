"mixer_batchfile_<StreamerName>.txt" contain the links to the Videos that were downloaded.

Due to the vod regulations that limits how long they are available in the end these specific batch-files were not used to download them. A separate batch-file was created in which the oldest vod were listed and downloaded.

If a blank line is found in one of the given batch-file it usually means that the vod probably weren't downloaded.
